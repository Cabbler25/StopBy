Project Description:
• MVP: An application that will facilitate people meeting by using GPS/geolocation to locate nearby people who are interested in meeting others in the area. It will include a profile for each user that includes their information and hobbies as well as a messaging system that allows users to talk to each other before they meet.
• Add-on Features:
① Friend System: Add people you enjoyed meeting and would like to meet again
② Nearby Events: Find ongoing events near users
③ Nearby Restaurants: Find nearby restaurants and sort it by the price
④ Friend Matching: help find people who are more likely to become users’ friends based on the	hobbies they leave in their profiles
 
User Story:
• I want to find somebody to keep me company when I am alone in the library and other places.
• I want to meet new people and make new friends.
• I want an app that allows me to see myself and other users on a map and be able to communicate with them.
 
Potential Team Roles: (*All of this is tentative*)
• Front end/Design: Yuanjian Liao
• Chat features:  Rachel Redder
• Profile: Iman Abdul-Rashed
• Geolocation: Danny Araujo
